# Word-Count
The HTML code you've provided is a basic HTML document structure with a reference to an external JavaScript file, "countwords.js," that is loaded as an ES6 module. Additionally, there's an empty div element with the id "count" and an h1 element with red text.

Here's a breakdown of your HTML structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the document type declaration, specifying that the document is written in HTML.

<html lang="en">: The opening tag for the HTML document, with the specified language attribute "en" for English.

<head>: This is the head section of the HTML document where you typically include metadata and external resources.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, which is set to UTF-8 (a widely used character encoding for handling text in various languages).

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This meta tag is often used for responsive web design. It sets the initial scale to 1.0 and adapts the viewport width to the device width.

<title>Document</title>: This is the title of your web page, which appears in the browser tab.

<body>: The body of the HTML document, where you place the content visible on the web page.

<script type="module" src="countwords.js">: This line imports an external JavaScript file named "countwords.js" as an ES6 module. It will be executed as a module, and its code can interact with the page's DOM.

<h1 style="color: red;">words with count</h1>: This is an h1 (heading 1) element with red text. It displays the text "words with count."

<div id="count">: This is an empty div element with the id "count." It will likely be used to display content generated by the JavaScript code in "countwords.js."

</body>: Closes the body section of the HTML document.

</html>: Closes the HTML document.

It seems like the page's content, such as the word count, will be generated and displayed by the JavaScript code in "countwords.js." If you have any specific questions or need further information about how to use or develop the JavaScript code or the purpose of the "countwords.js" file, please provide more details or context.
